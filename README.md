moodle-langpack_de_gender
=========================

Moodle language pack with asterisk gendering


Motivation for this language pack
---------------------------------

This Moodle language pack is a sub-language pack of the official `de` language pack.
While the `de` language pack does gendering with the '/innen' syntax, this language pack does gendering with the asterisk syntax.


Coverage
--------

Currently, this language pack covers all Moodle Core strings as well as several selected Moodle third party plugins.
Strings which are not contained in this language pack do not need gendering and are taken from the parent `de` language pack.


Installation
------------

Download the language pack folder and place it into
/MOODLEDATA/lang/de_gender

Afterwards, purge caches. Then, the language pack is available within Moodle and can be selected in the language picker.

See https://docs.moodle.org/en/Language_packs#Manual_language_pack_installation for details.


Moodle release and update support
---------------------------------

Currently, this language pack is built for Moodle 3.9.
It is not yet available from within AMOS (https://lang.moodle.org) and thus is maintained manually from time to time.
